Wearable Pressure Matrix Sensor for Lymphatic Drainage System Feedback and Monitoring

This repository hosts the development of a wearable pressure matrix sensor designed to provide feedback and monitoring capabilities for a lymphatic drainage system. The sensor employs advanced pressure sensing technology to capture real-time data related to pressure distribution and changes during lymphatic drainage therapy sessions. Through this repository, we aim to foster collaboration, share progress, and contribute to the advancement of wearable sensor technology in healthcare applications.
