Bill of Materials so far

We are going to need 2 MUX with 16 channels each to create the 32 points grid map

Now, we are going to need a microcontroller with at least 10 digital pins and 2 analog pins. 
I suggest using an ESP8266 or ESP32 because they operate at high clock frequencies and have other functionalities that may be useful. 
The only problem is that they work at 3.3V, which is lower than the operational voltage of the CD74HC4067, and will require additional power adaptations.
Another option is to use an Arduino Nano board, which operates at 5V. However, it is a very basic board, and adding other functionalities may be more difficult later on.

Additional materials may be:

3mm Copper tape for the matrix building

Velostat to act like the variable dieletric

Ultrathin wire to make conections without hurting the user
